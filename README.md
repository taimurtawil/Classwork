## My Experience

I started coding in my sophmore year of college because it was a part of the course work for the Math major. I really enjoyed the course and it made me want to learn more. So I decided to switch my major to computer science and attempted to catch up to my peers by getting internships and making projects. I managed to snag an IT intenship at the beginning of last year where I got more familiar with hardware and networks. Also this past summer I lived in Buffalo doing a software engineer internship for M&T Bank where I worked with multiple technologies including React and Django. My projects include a Rental POS system, musician landing and scheduling tool, and collaborative notes app. 

## What I hope to learn from this course

I hope to learn another javascript framework in depth and see how my knowledge of react can apply to vue. I also want to create more projects that I can hopefully throw on my resume. Finally I would love it if we could learn more about deployment and maintenance.
